# Findings and Recommendations
In this project, it was discovered that the company lacks a career development plan. As a result, high-performing employees are leaving due to the absence of opportunities for career growth. To address this issue, the company needs to establish a proper structure focused on career development. Employees are not only concerned with salary but also with opportunities to develop their skills, add value, and increase productivity. The company should schedule and organize training sessions, seminars, workshops, and other capacity-building programs for all staff to participate in.
